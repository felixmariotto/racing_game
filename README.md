# Racing Game

this is inspired by [this GIF on Twitter](https://twitter.com/Clandestine_vox/status/1301133609068359680) and by my favourite game ever F-Zero GX.

## This is a prototype, playable in multiplayer

## How it works

The physics is computed in the server [here](https://github.com/felixmariotto/racing_game/blob/master/modules/updateGame.js).

The maps are randomnly generated by the server [here](https://github.com/felixmariotto/racing_game/blob/master/modules/buildMap.js).

The server receives user inputs via socket.io [here](https://github.com/felixmariotto/racing_game/blob/a14ca16238f74b830e903bf54e2ace5e4af7a8f4/app.js#L30-L96).

The client, when receiving a game map, build a single mesh with UVs mapped according to the tile type, [here](https://github.com/felixmariotto/racing_game/blob/master/src/js/GameMap.js).

On client side, [the GameControl](https://github.com/felixmariotto/racing_game/blob/master/src/js/GameControl.js) module is the central engine to manage the game.
